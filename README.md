# RISC-V Assembler & Simulator
---

### Description
This project is a simple assembler for a subset of the RISC-V instruction set. It takes assembly code as input and translates it into corresponding machine code using predefined opcodes and register mappings. The assembler supports R, I, S, B, and J-type instructions and handles basic control flow operations like branching and jumping.

---

### Features 
* **Assembly Code Conversion:** Translates assembly instructions into machine code.
* **Instruction Support:** Implements various instruction types (R, I, S, B, and J) including arithmetic (e.g., add, sub, slt, srl), logical (e.g., or, and), memory access (e.g., lw, sw), and control flow instructions (e.g., beq, bne, blt, jal, jalr). Additional instructions like mul, rst, and halt are defined for future extensions.
* **Opcode Mapping:** Uses an external opcodes.json file to map each assembly instruction to its corresponding binary opcode, function3, and function7 codes.
* **Register Mapping:** Utilizes a JSON-based register mapping to translate register names (e.g., a0, a1, x0) into their binary representations.
* **Label Handling:** Processes labels and branch instructions to support conditional and unconditional jumps within the assembly code.
* **Comment Support:** Allows inline comments in the assembly source for clarity and documentation.

### Installation & Usage 
##### Prerequisites
* Python 3.6 or higher
* Git (optional, for repository cloning)

##### Installation
1. Clone the Repository:
   Use the following command to clone the project repository:
   [> git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-assembler-project.git](https://)

2. Navigate to Project Directory:
```python
   > cd your-assembler-project
```
3. Ensure all files are present
   The project should include:
   * Assembler.py - The main assembler script
   * opcodes.json - Contains the mapping for instruction opcodes
   * registers.json - Contains the mapping and information for processor registers.

---

### Running the Assembler
To assemble an input file containing assembly code, run:
```python
> python Assembler.py inp.txt
```
Here inp.txt is a text file with your assembly instructions.

When you run the assembler with the above file, it will convert each instruction into the corresponding machine code based on the opcode and register mappings provided in **opcodes.json** and the register mapping file.

---

### File Structure
* **Assembler.py:**
The main Python script that reads and processes assembly code. It handles parsing instructions, resolving labels, and converting assembly instructions into machine code using the provided opcode and register mappings.

* **opcodes.json:**
A JSON file that contains the mapping of assembly instructions to their corresponding binary opcodes, funct3, and funct7 codes. It supports various instruction types (R, I, S, B, and J), with placeholders for instructions like "mul", "rst", and "halt" for future enhancements.

* **Register Mapping File:**
A JSON-based file (or code snippet) that maps register names (e.g., "a0", "a1", "x0", etc.) to their respective binary codes. This file is crucial for translating human-readable register names into binary representations required by the machine code.

* **Assembly Source File (e.g., program.asm):**
An example assembly file containing the source code for your program. This file includes sample instructions, labels, and comments to illustrate the assemblerâ€™s capabilities.

---

### Future Work and Improvements

* **Assembler Enhancements:**
Extend support for additional instructions, such as the placeholders for mul, rst, and halt, to further expand the assembler's capabilities.

* **Simulator Integration:**
Develop a simulator that can execute the machine code generated by the assembler. This would enable real-time testing, debugging, and visualization of how the code runs on a simulated processor.

* **Error Handling & Debugging:**
Enhance error reporting to provide more detailed feedback when assembly code contains syntax errors or undefined labels, making it easier to debug and correct mistakes.

* **Optimization:**
Explore optimization techniques to speed up the assembly process, especially for larger codebases.

* **User Interface:**
Consider developing a graphical user interface (GUI) to make the tool more accessible to beginners and those who prefer a visual approach to learning assembly language.
